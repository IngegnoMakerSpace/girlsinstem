                 Learn what it takes to be an engineer and dive heads-on into reverse engineering. Our <strong><em>Highway to Creativity in Reverse</em></strong> toolkit provides instructions on how to get acquainted with this field, basic theoretical background, ideas for fun and easy exercises and step by step instructions for 3 projects about manufacturing, electronics and programming.

              <h3>Want to participate?</h3>
              <p>Would you like to participate in our bootcamps?</p>
              <p>We are looking for young girls (between 14 and 25 years of age) interested in STEM and motivated to participate in an amazing interchange experience. This is a great chance to explore new topics, realize which are your interests and get support to achieve your potentials.</p>
              <h3>Reverse Engineering Bootcamp</h3>
              <p>There will be a bootcamp dedicated to this toolkit in Valladolid, Spain, from 28/06/2021 to 03/07/2021, which can be attended by young girls from Belgium, France, Poland and Spain.</p>
              <p>
                  <strong>Date:</strong> 28/06/2021 to 03/07/2021  <br/>

              <ul>
                  <li>There are <strong>20</strong> places, all for girls. <strong>4</strong> are reserved for people living in Spain, the others for the partnering countries. </li>
                  <li>Location hostel: The Book Factory Hostel: Calle Para√≠so, 8, 47003 Valladolid, Spanje</li>
                  <li>Location activities: Espacio Joven Norte: Calle Olmo, 61, 47010 Valladolid, Spanje</li>

              </ul>
              <p><strong>Schedule:</strong> We discover the wonders of reverse engineering through techniques such as 3D printing, virtual reality and code. With this background we make, for example, a vacuum cleaner of a hairdryer or we design a smoke machine. </p>
              <p>Valladolid will also have no more secrets. Tuesday we discover what the city has to offer (sigthseeing) with an interactive workshop and we will visit the science museum. You can participate in the open-mic or Erasmus night in the youth center where we hold the activities.
