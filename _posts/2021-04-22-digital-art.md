!DROPS made a promo video for the Digital Art Toolkit. The toolkit will be usedin the bootcamp in Ghent (29.10.2021 - 02.11.2021). The full video can be [watched on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EXUhEd_8Zk).

The digital art toolkit focuses on robotic arts and digital sound/music making. It provides guidelines to combine coding with visual arts and to produce sounds via programmable boards coupled with sensors and actuators.
