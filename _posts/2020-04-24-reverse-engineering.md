In the first part of the project, the toolkits are developed. At `De Creatieve STEM`, we are working on the Reverse Engineering Toolkit. 

We started with:

* What is Reverse Engineering?
* How can workshops around it best be structured?
* What should be the content of the Toolkit? 

After brainstorming, we started with the development of the different activities for the toolkit, to further refine its content. 

A first activity Lennard worked on was hacking a hair dryer, and reusing the components to create a completely different device: a smoke blower.
